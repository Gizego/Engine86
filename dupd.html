		Recently added:
	</div>
		<ul>
		<li>
		Support for TrueType font loading. The FreeType library wasn't working on GCC and I was unable to build it by myself.
		Now, I got it replaced by stb_truetype.
		</li>
		<br />		
		<li>
		Regular polygon generator in the GeometryMesh class.
		</li>
		<br />
		<li>
		2-dimensional scale.
		</li>
		<br />
		<li>		
		Lots of UI elements, from text boxes to radio buttons.
		</li>
		<br />
		<li>
		Optimization.
		</li>
		</ul>
		<div style="font-family:arial; font-size:18px; font-weight: bold;">
		Beeing added:
		</div>
		<ul>
		<li>
		A costum pixel engine. If your computer doesn't support OpenGL 3.0 I'll be adding a tool that allows the CPU to
		draw the graphics and then load the pixels to the GPU over OpenGL 1.0. It won't be fast and you might not get over 30FPS
		but the game will at least work.
		</li>
