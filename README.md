# Engine86

  This game framework was built on C++ and provides an easy way to render images and 2D geometry. It also provides an audio engine for tilemapping games, the main focus of this engine. I tried to give you control over the game loop, so you can make your application without any constraint and get the performance you wouln't get from an ECS system.
  The engine uses OpenGL for graphics but support for a custom CPU pixel engine is predicted. OpenAL is used for audio and GLFW for context creation. TrueType support is being added for the GCC compiler, due to problems with compiling the freetype library.
  
  List of utilities:
  
    - Support for loading text files handling BOM headers;
    - Random number Generator;
    - Timers and Stopwatches;
    - Hardware information;
    - Image loading;
    - Font loading;
