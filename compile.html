	Windows MinGW:
	</div>
	<br />
	The engine was made for GCC. With MinGW you should get everything you need.
	<br />
	The libraries in the "dependencies" folder were compiled for windows so you won't have to build any dependency.
	<br />
	The build32.bat and build64.bat files should be slightly altered to match your MinGW/bin folder.
	<br />
	<br />
	<br />
	<div style="font-family:arial; font-size:18px; font-weight: bold;">
	Visual Studio on Windows:
	</div>
	<br />
	This is untested but you will have to rebuild GLFW (<a href="https://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/compile.html">Build guide here</a>) to a MSVC library.
	<br />
	Make a solution file and statically link the libraries in the "dependencies folder" for your targeted CPU architecture.
	<br />
	<br />
	<br />
	<div style="font-family:arial; font-size:18px; font-weight: bold;">
	Linux and Mac GCC:
	</div>
	<br />
	In this case, you'll have to rebuild all the libraries for your platform.
	<br />
	You'll extract some important information from the BAT file. It won't work directly on your platfrom but it shows you what you should do with GCC.
	<br />
	Don't forget to change the path of the libraries and remove the -lgdi32 dependency.
